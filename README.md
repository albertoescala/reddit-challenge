# Reddit Project

## Technologies Used
- NextJS
- Axios
- Redux
- Emotion
- Jest

## Usage
For run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

For run the tests:

```bash
yarn test
# or
yarn test:watch
```

## Challenges
To make this challenge even greater, I decided not to use ui libraries like antd or material-ui that give you ready-made components because I want to demonstrate what I can do without depending on design libraries.

In addition to completing the requirements, I decided to add a small login flow.
